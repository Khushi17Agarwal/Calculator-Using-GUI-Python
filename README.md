# Calculator-Using-GUI-Python
Created a mini project using Tkinter library in Python in which we can perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Here are some explanations for each button and their corresponding functions:

**1st Row**

This row contains the numeral 0 with an arithmetic operator(/) division symbol used for dividing numbers and an assignment operator (=) is equal to symbol from which we can obtain our output and a clear button through which we can erase the numerals or operators that we are using in our calculation.

**5th Row**

This row contains (.) decimal.

In these rows are :

-> The basic number buttons (0 to 9).

-> The basic math symbols (operators) (+, -, *, /).

-> The equal sign (=) and point (.).

If any syntax error is encountered in the entry box then it returns an error.
